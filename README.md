# Android Guidelines and Tools

List of guidelines and libraries that we use at __brightec__ when developing for the __Android__ platform.

* [Project Guidelines](project_guidelines.md)
* [Java - Code Guidelines](code_guidelines_java.md)
* [Kotlin - Code Guidelines](code_guidelines_kotlin.md)
* [XML - Code Guidelines](code_guidelines_xml.md)
* [Logging](logging.md)

Internally we use [Config_Android](https://github.com/brightec/Config_Android) _(internal use only)_. This should added to  every Android project.

android_studio_settings.jar is out of date. Ask for it to be updated if required
